Project Description:
This project aims to write a program that behaves like the Canvas Learning Management 
System. 

The project should have the following functionalities:

General:
1. Allow users (students and faculty) to register accounts and login.
2. Allow users to search for other students using their name or email addresss.
3. Allow users to logout.
4. Allow students and faculty to create announcements.

Faculty:
1. Allow faculty to create quizzes for students to take within set time.
2. Allow faculty to upload quiz answers for auto-grading.
3. Allow faculty to analyse the performance of students across quizzes or assignments.

Students:
1. Allow student to take quizzes uploaded by faculty.
2. Allow student to view quiz scores after grading, the class mean, lowest, upper and 
lower quartiles.

NB:
- The program is supposed to use a text (.txt) file(s) to store data necessary for 
running the application. 
- The program should equally persist the data such that the data is not lost after 
the program ends.
