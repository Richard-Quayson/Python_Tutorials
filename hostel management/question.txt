The Housing Office at a university wants to create a program to manage the 
allocation of dormitory rooms for the upcoming academic year. They need your 
help to design a Python program to automate this process. The program should 
be able to assign rooms to students, keep track of the available and occupied 
rooms, and provide room assignments based on certain criteria.
